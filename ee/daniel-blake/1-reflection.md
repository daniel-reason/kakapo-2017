Why is reflection important?
Reflection is an important part of the learning process as it provides a way to look back, understand and provide awareness around what you have done well, and what you could improve one. Being able to reflect provides the chance to understand your strengths and weaknesses and provides the opportunity to continually improve and get the most out of your education experience.

What did I do well this week?
This week my main goal was to get a good understanding of how to use the terminal to effectively navigate the file structure and create, move and copy files and directories. This was something I can now do! I also wanted to learn how git actually worked, I sort of know what it was and didn't know how it worked in a practical sense - now I know how to use it to clone, pull and push changes!
I also felt I did well in terms of getting back into the swing of study again, setting myself mini daily goals on what I wanted to achieve.

What could I have done to improve?
Mainly time keeping and remembering to use Toggle! I have now stuck a little sticker on my laptop that says "Toggl" to remind myself to do!
