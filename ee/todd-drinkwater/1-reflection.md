Why is reflection important?

As stated in the article Learning By Thinking: How Reflection Improves Performance (http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/learning-by-thinking-how-reflection-improves-performance):

"Learning from direct experience can be more effective if coupled with reflectionâ€”that is, the intentional attempt to synthesize, abstract, and articulate the key lessons taught by experience."

Going back to being a student, I think it is important to reflect on the challenges I faced, what made them challenging, how I responded when faced with these challenges, and how I could improve on this for the future. Considering these factors will make me far more prepared when going through similar experiences in the future.

What did I do well this week?
Learning Github was an area I was particularly proud of being able to grasp. At first, some the concepts behind getting it to work seemed a bit abstract and it took a little while to get my head around it. The key thing that helped me here was having perseverance and looking for a range of different learning resources that helped me to gain different perspectives on how Github worked. I was also glad I had played around a bit HTML and CSS before, as the lessons were great to revise and reflect on what I had already learnt.


What could I have done to improve?
In hindsight, I should have tried some assignments before others to allow myself to work through them faster (e.g. 0.2 Master your tools). I also had a few issues with Toggl timer and this mucked up some of my tracking for the week. Upon reflection, I should have figured out completely how the program worked before attempting to time assignments.
