Reflection is important as it allows us to take stock of what we have done well and what we haven't. Rather than just judging ourselves on what we can remember by reflecting we can approach learning in a strategic way. We can relate an experience we have previously had to something we have today, a process known as scaffolding. Our experiences are an opportunity to enhance the way we learn and relate to others.

When you think about it the concept of reflecting seems like a no brainer but quite often we don't look at how we act or do and this means following the same pattern again and again.

This week I feel that I engaged with the coursework and tried to engage with my classmates. I applied myself well and got through a decent chunk of the work.

Perhaps I asked for assistance then found that I figured it out myself so I could wait before asking. I also think that I could spend less time worrying where everyone else is up to and look at it more collaboratively. Maybe I am concerned of being left behind so as the course advances I hope this will change.
