Question: Why is reflection important?

Answer: Reflection is important because it enables a person to review what they have been doing and improve. If you don't reflect, you're not going to know where you went wrong and you will continue to make the same mistakes over and over. Not only is reflection good for picking out the things you could do better. Reflection is also important because it can give a person a sense of satisfaction and a reason to celebrate the things they have done right.

Question: What did I do well this week?

Answer: This week I think the perseverance I have demonstrated has been something I have done well. I've had moments where I feel like I have no idea what I am doing but rather than giving up as soon as things feel tough, I did my research and kept working until I completed the task.

Question: What could I have done to improve?

Answer: I could improve on my time management a lot. This week I have noticed that I am spending too much time on some tasks and not enough time on other tasks. Something else I need to improve on is using Toggl to track my time. For the first few assignments I didn't use it at all. I do use it when I remember to activate it (I'm using it as I write this). But I always forget to reactivate it. I'm confident that over time I will get used to using Toggl and that this will no longer be an issue.
